##Personal Blog in React

[Check it out!](https://gness1804.github.io/blog-in-react/)

This is a rebuild of my personal blog using React. It contains the following improvements over the [last version](https://github.com/gness1804/Personal-Blog):

* Only shows five most recent posts by default; user can elect to view all posts or only one given post by clicking on a button or the post itself respectively.
* Blog is much easier to maintain because the list of posts updates automatically.

The blog uses a JavaScript object to store the posts and then populates them onto the page using an array. This makes it much more versatile and effective than the last version.

    body: 'I just completed a two-day course on iOS development with Erika Carlson of Detroit Labs (www.detroitlabs.com). I learned a great deal about developing for iOS during this intensive session. In particular, we delved into the Swift language and built some basic apps. I was excited to learn from Erika and to work with such talented and passionate people during this experience. Thanks to them and most of all to Erika for everything! It certainly gave me a lot to think about moving forward.',

    body: "My fellow students Gabi Procell and Lacey Knaff and I just finished Bluecifer's Revenge, a side-scrolling game where you must keep your avatar, the eponymous demonic horse from Denver International Airport (DIA), from hitting airplanes or falling to the ground as he flies (yes, flies) back home to DIA. The airplanes get faster as the score increases, and I also added an 'Easter Egg' that the intrepid gamer might just encounter.\r I am a new line.",

    body: 'I just completed a two-day course on iOS development with Erika Carlson of <a href="https://www.detroitlabs.com/" target="_blank">Detroit Labs.</a> I learned a great deal about developing for iOS during this intensive session. In particular, we delved into the Swift language and built some basic apps. I was excited to learn from Erika and to work with such talented and passionate people during this experience. Thanks to them and most of all to Erika for everything! It certainly gave me a lot to think about moving forward.',
